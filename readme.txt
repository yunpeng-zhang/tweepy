Analysing Streaming Tweets with Python and PostgreSQL

1. install PostgreSQL12, which is supported by Heroku
2. Use PDAdmin Tool to create a localhost server and TwitterDB
3. create Twitter Developer Account to obtain the API
4. verify authentication
5. streaming data
6. streaming tweets on keywords
7. streaming tweets using stream listener 
The streamlistener is missing in the source files and need to added back. 
8. create datatables
9. stream data into database
tweepy_steamlistener.py
10. analyze the data
this works find except that the tables do not show in vs code.
